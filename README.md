# Designs

Welcome to my Designs Repository – a curated collection of CAD and 3D 
models created using various design tools including **SOLIDWORKS** and 
**Blender**. This repository features designs ranging from 
beginner-friendly models to complex mechanical assemblies, with a 
special focus on robotics components and systems.

Whether you're a student, hobbyist, or robotics enthusiast, this 
repository is designed to help you:

- Understand parametric modeling basics
- Learn best practices in CAD and 3D modeling
- Explore real-world mechanical parts used in robotics and various 
projects
- Access ready-to-use models for your own projects

## Repository Structure

Models are organized by software/tool used:

- **Solidworks** 
- **Blender** 

## Getting Started

- Browse the folders based on your interest, skill level, or required software
- Download and use or modify the designs in your own projects
- Check individual folders for file formats available (.SLDPRT, .STEP, .
STL, .blend, etc.)

## Focus on Robotics

This repository includes robotics-centric designs such as:

- Actuator mechanisms
- Arm and gripper assemblies
- Sensor mounts and integration systems
- Custom mechanical components

## Usage & Licensing

All models in this repository are free to use for:

- Personal projects
- Educational purposes
- Prototyping and testing
- Commercial projects (attribution appreciated)

Please credit this repository if you use these models in your projects.

## Contributions

While this is a personal design collection, collaborators are welcome to:

- Suggest improvements or modifications
- Share ideas for new designs
- Report issues with existing models
- Contribute your own models (SOLIDWORKS, Onshape, Blender, or other CAD 
tools)

Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request!
